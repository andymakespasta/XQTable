# XQTable
The goal is to design a programming language targeted towards everyday personal use:

1. Easy to use for short scripts
2. Fun to program in and easy to debug

Core Design:

1. Table based 2d language, like funge, except each cell has unlimited space, and commands are short strings
2. All variables and states during execution are visible and on the table (no stacks)
3. Short Scripts Can Co-exist with data


The core features of the editor/interpreter are:
1. Browser-based for maximum portability
2. All keywords and special strings should be highlighted (lots of feedback)
3. Code execution is always step by step (debug mode)
